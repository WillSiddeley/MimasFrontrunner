# MimasFrontrunner
Mimas is a crypto lending platform on the Cronos EVM chain. They offer free tokens to anyone who calls the updateOracles() method in their smart contract to update their price feeds. 

This bot was created to frontrun the guy who is currently draining the Mimas faucet. When the number of free tokens is greater than a threshold it signs a transaction and broadcasts it to the Cronos blockchain to claim the tokens.

Update 11/24/2022: Mimas price has dropped so low it is no longer profitable. This repo will be for storing the code only.
